# Angular Basic
## What is Angular?
Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript.

As a platform, Angular includes:

- A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
- A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
- A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
  
With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.

## Getting Started
- Install [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install Angular CLI
  `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Create a workspace and initial application
  `ng new angular-basic`
- Run the application
  ```
    cd my-app
    ng serve --open
  ```
